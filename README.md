# AVFoundationSimplePlayer-iOS: Using AVFoundation to Play Media

Demonstrates how to create a simple movie playback app using only the AVPlayer and AVPlayerLayer classes from AVFoundation (not AVKit). You'll see how to load a movie file as an AVAsset and then how to implement various functionality including play, pause, fast forward, rewind, time slider updating, and scrubbing.

Implements Segment's [Video Spec](https://segment.com/docs/spec/video/) and [Segment-Nielsen-DCR](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics-ios-integration-nielsen-dcr).
